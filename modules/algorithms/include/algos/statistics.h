 * result from randomness of the sampling process). Data are no independently distributed, if they exhibit serial
 * correlation.
 *
 * The test statistic is:
 *
 * \f[
 * Q = n\left(n+2\right)\sum_{k=1}^h\frac{\hat{\rho}^2_k}{n-k}
 * \f]
 *
 * where ''n'' is the sample size, \f$\hat{\rho}k \f$ is the sample autocorrelation at lag ''k'', and ''h'' is the
 * number of lags being tested. Under \f$ H_0 \f$ the statistic Q follows a \f$\chi^2{(h)} \f$. For significance level
 * \f$\alpha\f$, the \f$critical region\f$ for rejection of the hypothesis of randomness is:
 *
 * \f[
 * Q > \chi_{1-\alpha,h}^2
 * \f]
 *
 * where \f$ \chi_{1-\alpha,h}^2 \f$ is the \f$\alpha\f$-quantile of the chi-squared distribution with ''h'' degrees of
