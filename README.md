# Shapelets Compute

`Shapelets Compute` is a python library with key algorithms to deal with data mining and 
machine learning tasks over time series using OpenCL and CUDA devices.  

`Shapelets Compute` provides:
  * Accelerated array operations, based on [ArrayFile](https://arrayfire.com/), including broadcasting, linear algebra, Fourier transform and radom number capabilities. 
  * A similiar API to [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
  * Fastest implementation of [Matrix Profile](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html) for CPU and GPU architectures ([SCAMP](https://github.com/zpzim/SCAMP)).
  * One of the largest collection of distance meassures.
  * and much more...

Besides its immediate application to analyse time series, Shapelets Compute arrays can be 
used in combination with all other libraries present in the Python ecosystem.
